# Matterhorn-Studio-DM-project
This 'Matterhorn-Studio-DM-project' file is for Machine Learning project at Matterhorn Studio, specifically for Bayesian Optimisation of Laser Beams with Deformable Mirrors.
## take_picture_for_large_data_set.ipynb
'take_picture_for_large_data_set.ipynb' includes the codes how to control the Thorlab Camera by python, how to edit the pixel size, the exposure time, and how to save them with PWM values as the filename. This code is what I used for collecting my large data size (80000 images) to train my six binary classifiers. (although only 5000 of them were used at the end.) This part of code can also work with GA to achieve the closed-loop system.
## pi_control.py
'ServoPi_Minimal.py' is provided by Prof Roland Smith at Imperial College London and 'pi_control.py' is my version how to use it. 'pi_control.py' is the code which controls raspberry pi by input the PWM values generated by the GA, updated in a real time with WinSCP software. The annealing code is also included in this file.
## quality_number_analysis_old_version.ipynb
'quality_number_analysis_old_version.ipynb' contains six old methods for analysing the quality of focal spot images. Import different image files and we can test the robustness and stability of each method.
